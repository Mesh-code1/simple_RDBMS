Implement a RDBMS (Relational database management system). There should be support for declaring tables with a few column data types, CRUD operations, basic indexing and primary and unique keying and some joining. The interface should be SQL, and it should have an interactive REPL mode.
 
Separately demonstrate the use of the RDBMS that you have implemented by writing a trivial web app that uses CRUD with the RDBMS created above (I have chosen to do a Bills Management Admin Panel).
